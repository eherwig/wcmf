# Model # {#model_main}

wCMF applications are based on a model. The model defines the key aspects of the
application on a higher abstraction level than code does. You can think of it as
a condensed description of the application.

A template based code generator transforms the model into source code that will
run inside the wCMF framework. Where necessary, the code can then be enhanced
manually inside pre-defined regions. Further generation runs will protect these
manual additions.

We believe that this approach helps to develop a clear concept of the application
and improves code quality and maintainability dramatically.

## Modeling ## {#model_create}

Technically the model is an [UML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language)
model that uses the Chronos [profile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profile_%28UML%29) from the
[Olympos](http://sourceforge.net/projects/olympos/) project. It is stored in
an XML file (e.g. `model.uml`). This file can be directly edited using
[Eclipse Papyrus](http://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/) or any other compatible UML
modeling tool. Alternatively  you can use the
[Chronos Web Modeler](http://sourceforge.net/projects/olympos/) that allows
browser based collaborative modeling. wCMF uses a minimized version of the code
generator from the Olympos project.
