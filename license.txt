Important Note For Projects That Need To Comply With EPL:
---------------------------------------------------------

The template engine Smarty is available only under the LGPL. 
Therefore, you have to select another template engine that 
is compatible to EPL or disable it (for example, if you are
only using the soap or json interface of wCMF). 
You can disable Smarty by setting the 'View' value in the 
'implementation' section in config.ini to 'NullView' and
adding the NullView class definition file to the 'classmapping' 
section.
